### USER
Ok so the user enters a prompt. Then what happens? What makes the process of orchestrating a response “agentic” and what makes an agentic system good?

### ASSISTANT
When a user enters a prompt in a local Ollama-compatible agentic system, several steps occur to generate a meaningful response. Here's how this process works, highlighting what makes it "agentic" and why an effective agentic system is crucial:

### Process Flow

1. **Prompt Ingestion**:
   - The user input (prompt) is captured through the interface (UI, API, or command line).
   - Initial validation checks ensure the prompt is properly formatted.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The prompt may be preprocessed to clean and normalize text.
   - Tokenization: Breaking down the text into smaller components for analysis.

3. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - The agent attempts to understand the context of the user's input, considering previous interactions if it's part of an ongoing conversation.

4. **Model Selection and Execution**:
   - Based on the type of prompt or task, the system selects the appropriate AI model (e.g., NLP for text-based tasks).
   - Executes the model to generate a response.

5. **Post-Processing**:
   - The raw output from the model might be post-processed to improve readability or apply specific formatting rules.
   - This could include sentiment analysis, entity recognition, etc.

6. **Response Generation**:
   - The processed response is then formatted and returned to the user through the interface (UI, API, or command line).

### What Makes a System "Agentic"?

1. **Autonomy**: The ability of the system to make decisions independently based on predefined rules or learned patterns.
2. **Contextual Awareness**: Maintaining state across multiple interactions to provide coherent and relevant responses.

### USER
Based on everything you’ve said so far, explain in extreme detail, what a framework would look like for a jupyter notebook that does everything you’ve explained; a simple but complete, “good agentic system” in a jupyter notebook which accepts a prompt from the user, connects to an ollama instance, preprocesses the prompt, decomposes problems and tasks, selects from the available models on the ollama server or asks the user to provide some missing model, spawns and instructs agents with appropriate models, collates and integrates results from the agents, and generates an appropriate response.  
  
Explain in excruciating detail how all of this would work and how it would integrate all the best practices you’ve laid out so far. In your response, elaborate on any further work that needs to happen to expand or clarify particular points or relevant tasks in the development of this new jupyter notebook. This document you area about to create will form the basis of a new agentic system which will be scaffolded around the document, and build itself by following the instructions and filling in the missing components. The system should be able to expand and improve itself incrementally as it works through the task of building itself as well as the ongoing task of responding to user prompts.  
  
For example, in the process of collecting and collating and integrating agents which are reporting back to the “project manager” thread, there should be a review step where the quality of the response is analyzed and the development opportunities of the agent are elaborated on for future review during a self-improvement phase where agents are empowered to improve their scaffolding and agent-prompts in order to deliver better results in the future.

### ASSISTANT
Creating a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook framework that serves as a "good agentic system" involves several key steps. The notebook will integrate with an Ollama instance, preprocess user prompts, decompose tasks, select appropriate models, coordinate agents, collect results, and generate responses. Additionally, it should have mechanisms for self-improvement and scalability.

Here's a detailed outline of how such a framework could be structured:

### Jupyter Notebook Framework Outline

#### 1. Initial Setup
- **Install Dependencies**: Ensure required libraries are installed.
- **Connect to Ollama Instance**: Establish connection parameters to the Ollama server.

```python
# Install necessary packages
!pip install ollama-sdk requests jupyter pandas

import ollama_sdk as ollama
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd

# Define connection details to Ollama instance
OLLAMA_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
```

#### 2. User Input Handling
- **Accept Prompt**: Create a function to accept user input via the Jupyter Notebook interface.

```python
def get_user_prompt():
    from IPython.display import display, HTML
    prompt_html = """
        <form action="javascript:submitPrompt()">
            <label for="user_prompt">Enter your prompt:</label><br>
            <input type="text" id="user_prompt" name="user_prompt"><br><br>
            <input type="button" value="Submit Prompt" onclick="submitPrompt()">
        </form>

        <script>
            function submitPrompt() {
                var user_prompt = document.getElementById("user_prompt").value;
                google.colab.output.setData({text: user_prompt});
            }
        </script>
    """
    display(HTML(prompt_html))

# Collect user input
user_input = get_user_prompt()
```

#### 3. Preprocess Prompt
- **Clean and Normalize**: Functions to preprocess the prompt.

```python
def preprocess_prompt(user_input):
    # Basic text cleaning
    cleaned_prompt = user_input.strip().lower()

    # Tokenization example
    tokens = cleaned_prompt.split(' ')

    return cleaned_prompt, tokens

cleaned_prompt, tokens = preprocess_prompt(user_input)
```

#### 4. Task Decomposition
- **Decompose Problem**: Break down the prompt into smaller tasks.

```python
def decompose_tasks(tokens):
    # Placeholder for task decomposition logic
    tasks = []
    current_task = []

    for token in tokens:
        if token == 'and':
            tasks.append(current_task)
            current_task = []
        else:
            current_task.append(token)

    if current_task:
        tasks.append(current_task)

    return tasks

tasks = decompose_tasks(tokens)
```

#### 5. Model Selection and Agent Spawning
- **Select Models**: Check available models, request user for missing ones.

```python
def select_models(tasks):
    selected_models = {}

    # Example: Assume we have a simple mapping of task types to model names
    task_to_model = {
        'classification': 'model_classification',
        'generation': 'model_generation'
    }

    for task in tasks:
        if not task or len(task) < 2:
            continue

        task_type = task[0]  # First word as a simple example
        model_name = task_to_model.get(task_type)

        if model_name:
            selected_models[' '.join(task)] = model_name
        else:
            model_name = input(f"Please provide a model name for the task: {' '.join(task)}")
            selected_models[' '.join(task)] = model_name

    return selected_models

selected_models = select_models(tasks)
```

- **Spawn Agents**: Instruct agents with appropriate models.

```python
def spawn_agents(selected_models):
    agents = {}

    for task, model in selected_models.items():
        agent_config = {
            'task': task,
            'model_name': model
        }

        # Simulate spawning an agent with the given model configuration
        agents[task] = ollama.spawn_agent(OLLAMA_SERVER_URL, agent_config)

    return agents

agents = spawn_agents(selected_models)
```

#### 6. Collect and Integrate Results
- **Collate Responses**: Gather results from all spawned agents.

```python
def collect_results(agents):
    responses = {}

    for task, agent in agents.items():
        # Fetch the result from each agent (simulated here)
        response = ollama.get_agent_response(agent)

        # Store the task and its corresponding response
        responses[task] = response

    return responses

responses = collect_results(agents)
```

- **Integrate Responses**: Combine results into a coherent final response.

```python
def integrate_responses(responses):
    final_response = ""

    for task, response in responses.items():
        final_response += f"Task: {task} - Response: {response}\n"

    return final_response

final_response = integrate_responses(responses)
print(final_response)
```

#### 7. Quality Analysis and Self-Improvement
- **Review Responses**: Analyze quality and identify improvement areas.

```python
def review_quality(responses):
    # Placeholder for quality analysis logic
    for task, response in responses.items():
        print(f"Analyzing: Task - {task}, Response - {response}")

        # Simulated feedback collection
        feedback = input("Was the response satisfactory? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()

        if feedback == 'no':
            suggestions = input("Provide suggestions for improvement: ")
            responses[task]['improvement_suggestions'] = suggestions

    return responses

responses_with_review = review_quality(responses)
```

- **Self-Improvement**: Implement a mechanism to improve agent prompts and models.

```python
def self_improve(responses):
    # Apply improvements based on feedback
    for task, response in responses.items():
        if 'improvement_suggestions' in response:
            print(f"Improving task: {task}")
            new_model = input("Please provide a better model name (if applicable): ")
            selected_models[task] = new_model

            # Re-spawn agent with improved configuration
            agents[task] = ollama.spawn_agent(OLLAMA_SERVER_URL, {'task': task, 'model_name': new_model})

selected_models = self_improve(responses_with_review)
```

#### 8. Iterative Development and Expansion
- **Self-Expansion**: Enable the system to expand its capabilities incrementally.

```python
def iterative_development():
    while True:
        user_input = get_user_prompt()

        if not user_input:
            break

        cleaned_prompt, tokens = preprocess_prompt(user_input)
        tasks = decompose_tasks(tokens)

        selected_models = select_models(tasks)
        agents = spawn_agents(selected_models)

        responses = collect_results(agents)
        final_response = integrate_responses(responses)
        print(final_response)

        responses_with_review = review_quality(responses)
        self_improve(responses_with_review)

iterative_development()
```

### Further Work and Expansion

1. **Enhanced Preprocessing**: Implement advanced text preprocessing techniques, including language detection, sentiment analysis, entity recognition, etc.

## 5 – Quality, Evaluation & Self-Improvement

| Missing Piece                       | Notes                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automated eval harness**          | Use small golden datasets + rubric scoring (BLEU / BERTScore / custom rubric prompting)                     |
| **Feedback UX**                     | Simple thumbs-up / improvement text box persists to `Feedback` table                                        |
| **Prompt / agent autonomic tuning** | Periodic job that mines poor-score runs, tries few-shot prompt edits or different model params, logs deltas |
| **Version tracking**                | Tag each notebook release & model hash; write to `ModelVersion` so you can roll back                        |

---

## 6 – Developer Experience & CI/CD

* **Unit tests** for helper functions (pre-processing, decomposition) using `pytest`
* **Integration tests** that spin up a dummy Ollama container and run an end-to-end prompt
* **Pre-commit hooks** (black, ruff) and a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests + build Docker image
* **Notebook → Script export** (`jupyter nbconvert --to script`) so the same logic can run headless in prod

---

## 7 – User-Facing UX

* Real **Jupyter widgets** (`ipywidgets`) instead of raw HTML/JS for prompt input and streaming output
* **Progress indicators** per agent; expandable panels to inspect intermediate reasoning
* **Error surfacing**: nice Markdown block when an agent fails, with traceback collapsed by default
* **Multi-modal input** stubs (file upload, mic, image drag-drop) ready for later expansion

---

## 8 – Advanced Agent Features (stretch)

* **ReAct / Toolformer pattern** so agents can choose external tools (web search, calculator, code exec)
* **Planning vs. execution split**: a dedicated planner agent that outputs a JSON-LS tree of subtasks for executor agents
* **Policy/guard-rails**: moderation agent that screens outputs for toxicity / PII before display
* **Cost tracking** if you later point to paid models (token usage dashboard)

---

### Next Step

Turn every bullet above into a GitHub Issue or a Notebook *todo* cell.  Prioritize:

1. **Config + security layer** (otherwise you’ll hard-code and leak)
2. **Robust orchestration** (async + retry) — unlocks real parallelism
3. **Eval & feedback loop** — without it, “self-improvement” is just wishful thinking

Once those pillars are in, add UX polish and advanced agent behaviors incrementally.

### USER
Ok but first explain the logical elements of the pipeline that will be represented in the notebook, in order. Just do that and nothing else.

### ASSISTANT
1. **Environment & Config Initialization**
2. **User Prompt Capture**
3. **Prompt Pre-processing**
4. **Task Decomposition / Planning**
5. **Model Availability Check & Selection**
6. **Agent Instantiation & Parameterization**
7. **Orchestration / Scheduling of Agent Runs**
8. **Agent Inference Execution**
9. **Result Collation & Integration**
10. **Post-processing / Response Formatting**
11. **Quality Evaluation & Feedback Capture**
12. **Self-Improvement Loop (Prompt / Model Tuning)**
13. **State Persistence & Logging**

### USER
Ok explain how this decomposes into jupyter cells.

### ASSISTANT
Below is one practical break-down of those 13 logical elements into discrete Jupyter cells.
*All “Code” cells are assumed to use Python; “Markdown” cells provide narrative headings or inline docs.*

| **16** | *Markdown* | “8 — Agent Inference Execution”                                                 | —                                          |

This layout keeps each logical stage isolated, readable, and testable, while still allowing you to collapse or expand detail as the system matures.

### USER
Expand the markdown cells to include a verbose explanation of everything that happens in that cell and why, and how it relates to the pipeline, the approaches, and what constitutes a successful or good example of the kind of solutions that are possible to the problems being worked on in that cell. Do all of this and don't leave any of these things out for any of the markdown cells.

### ASSISTANT
---

### **Cell 0 — Notebook Title & Overview *(Markdown)***

> **Purpose:**
> This opening cell orients any reader—human or agentic—by stating **what the notebook is**, **why it exists**, and **how to use it**. A clear top-level description ensures that every downstream action can be traced back to an explicit problem statement and success metric, satisfying the “explainability / transparency” pillar of a good agentic system.
>
> **What happens in this cell?**
>
> * We give the notebook a descriptive name (e.g. “Local-Ollama Agentic Pipeline – Reference Implementation”).
> * We summarise, in two–three rich paragraphs, the full end-to-end flow that will unfold: user prompt → decomposition → agent scheduling → response → feedback → self-improvement.
> * We list the hardware / software assumptions (GPU class, Python ≥3.10, Ollama endpoint).
> * We declare the key performance indicators (KPIs) for *success*: latency < 2 s for simple tasks, BLEU/Accuracy ≥ x on test prompts, user rating ≥ 4 / 5.
>
> **Relation to the pipeline:**
> This cell sets the *contextual frame*—the same way an agent maintains a conversation memory—so all later stages can reference a shared goal. It satisfies the pipeline’s **Environment & Config Initialization** element *philosophically* (by declaring scope), before we do it *technically* in Cell 1-3.
>
> **What counts as “good”?**
>
> * Anyone unfamiliar with the project can, after reading, restate:
>
>   1. the problem, 2. the pipeline steps, 3. the expected outputs.
> * The overview doubles as README text if the notebook is converted to HTML.

---

### **Cell 2 — Section Header: “1 — Environment & Config Initialization” *(Markdown)***

> **Purpose:**
> Acts as a visible *chapter break* that groups Cells 1-3. Good notebook hygiene demands that narrative and code appear in tight, labelled pairs, so scrolling users never lose their place.
>
> **Explanation of the paired code (Cell 3):**
>
> * `import` statements guarantee deterministic environments.
> * A call to `load_config()` externalises secrets into `.env`, adhering to 12-factor-app practice.
> * `connect_ollama()` pings the inference server once so later cells fail fast if unreachable.
> * `setup_logging()` wires structured JSON logs, enabling downstream *State Persistence & Logging*.
>
> **Pipeline linkage:**
> This is the *first concrete instantiation* of **Element 1** in our 13-step logical flow.
>
> **What is a good solution?**
>
> * Re-running the cell on a clean machine boots without errors.
> * Mis-configurations surface within 1 s with actionable messages, not stack traces.

---

### **Cell 4 — Section Header: “2 — User Prompt Capture” *(Markdown)***

> **Purpose:**
> Introduces Cells 5’s interactive widget and explains the UX philosophy: low-friction input combined with traceable metadata (timestamp, session-ID).
>
> **Why it matters:**
>
> * All downstream agentic reasoning is only as good as the prompt fidelity.
> * Capturing *raw* and *sanitised* forms enables A/B testing of prompt-engineering tweaks in the *Self-Improvement Loop*.
>
> **Success criteria:**
>
> * Prompt appears in notebook state (`raw_prompt`) exactly as typed.
> * UI displays a “Submit” button greyed-out while empty, preventing null tasks.

---

### **Cell 6 — Section Header: “3 — Prompt Pre-processing” *(Markdown)***

> **Role in pipeline:**
> Bridges **Element 2** (capture) with **Element 3** (normalise). Transformations here must be *loss-less* (no semantic drift) yet *model-friendly*.
>
> **What the paired code does:**
>
> * Strips extraneous whitespace, harmonises Unicode, runs language detection for future model routing.
> * Outputs two artefacts: `cleaned_prompt` (string) and `tokens` (list).
> * Stores these in a transient cache for *Task Decomposition*.
>
> **Good example:**
> A prompt with emojis or smart quotes is normalised without dropping meaning, and token count is logged for cost estimation.

---

### **Cell 8 — Section Header: “4 — Task Decomposition / Planning” *(Markdown)***

> **Why decomposition?**
> Agentic systems thrive when large, fuzzy requests are broken into atomic, parallelisable units—mirroring human project management.
>
> **Narrative points to include:**
>
> * High-level algorithm choice (e.g., heuristic keyword split vs. LLM-powered ReAct planner).
> * Reference to modularity principle: each task later maps to one agent instance.
> * Mention of failure-impact: if planning is wrong, orchestration and collation suffer downstream.
>
> **Success metric:**
> The resulting `task_graph` (DAG) is acyclic and covers 100 % of prompt scope without overlap.

---

### **Cell 10 — Section Header: “5 — Model Availability Check & Selection” *(Markdown)***

> **Purpose:**
> Explains the validation loop where the notebook queries Ollama’s `/models` endpoint, compares against task requirements, and either auto-routes or prompts the user for new weights.
>
> **Key content:**
>
> * Rationale for **“Ask-if-Missing”** flow (prevents silent fallbacks to bad models).
> * Discussion of version pinning (`model:1.3-GPU-int8`) and reproducibility.
> * Mention cost/latency trade-offs guiding selection strategy.
>
> **Definition of success:**
> Every node in `task_graph` maps to an available model string by the end of Cell 11, or the run aborts gracefully with actionable advice.

---

### **Cell 12 — Section Header: “6 — Agent Instantiation & Parameterization” *(Markdown)***

> **Narrative to include:**
>
> * Definition of an **“agent”** in this context: a lightweight wrapper combining model, prompt-template, memory stub, and runtime kwargs (temperature, top-k).
> * Explanation of the **single-responsibility principle**: one agent per decomposed task for clarity and fault isolation.
> * Security note: agents receive only the data slice they need (principle of least privilege).
>
> **Success indicator:**
> After Cell 13 runs, `agents` dict length equals number of tasks; each entry exposes a `.run()` coroutine ready for orchestration.

---

### **Cell 14 — Section Header: “7 — Orchestration / Scheduling” *(Markdown)***

> **Why orchestration matters:**
> Converts a bag of agents into a *coherent workflow*—respecting task dependencies, enforcing timeouts, and maximising resource utilisation.
>
> **Concepts explained:**
>
> * **Async event loop** (`asyncio`) vs. threadpool vs. external queue (e.g., Celery).
> * **Retry-with-jitter** strategy to avoid thundering-herd when multiple agents call GPU simultaneously.
> * **Circuit-breaker** pattern: if an agent fails 3×, mark its downstream tasks “SKIPPED”.
>
> **What “good” looks like:**
>
> * Average concurrency > 80 % of GPU utilisation; zero deadlocks; failures surfaced in < 1 s.

---

### **Cell 16 — Section Header: “8 — Agent Inference Execution” *(Markdown)***

> **Focus of the markdown:**
>
> * Clarify streaming vs. blocking inference and why token-streaming improves UX.
> * Point out telemetry captured: latency, token count, prompt + response hashes (for replay).
>
> **Relation to approaches:**
> Embodies the *Autonomy* and *Proactivity* hallmarks: agents run without further human nudges once scheduled.
>
> **Success criteria:**
>
> * ≥ 95 % of agent runs complete within SLA; partial outputs are captured if aborted mid-stream.

---

### **Cell 18 — Section Header: “9 — Result Collation & Integration” *(Markdown)***

> **Purpose:**
> Narrates how disparate agent outputs are stitched into a single, ordered narrative—or a structured JSON, depending on prompt type.
>
> **Topics to cover:**
>
> * Merge strategies: simple concatenation, voting, chain-of-thought weave, or hierarchical summarisation.
> * Conflict resolution policy when two agents give contradictory facts (e.g., trust-score weighting).
>
> **Success definition:**
> The integrated object passes schema validation and contains no duplicate or conflicting keys.

---

### **Cell 20 — Section Header: “10 — Post-processing / Response Formatting” *(Markdown)***

> **Scope:**
>
> * Enhance readability: markdown formatting, code fencing, or HTML widgets.
> * Optional RAG-based citation enrichment: link facts to knowledge base vectors.
> * Sanity-check length vs. user channel (CLI vs. chat UI).
>
> **Reasoning link:**
> Aligns with pipeline’s *Explainability*: well-formatted output aids both user comprehension and future debugging.
>
> **Good outcome:**
> Rendered response scores ≥ 4 / 5 on human readability rubric and embeds working hyperlinks.

---

### **Cell 22 — Section Header: “11 — Quality Evaluation & Feedback Capture” *(Markdown)***

> **Purpose & Explanation:**
>
> * Present automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, custom rubric) *and* solicit human feedback.
> * Stress the need for *bidirectional* evaluation: quantitative + qualitative.
>
> **Pipeline tie-in:**
> This feeds directly into **Element 12** (Self-Improvement) by persisting feedback events for later mining.
>
> **What is successful?**
> Feedback UI allows a one-click rating; metrics logged in a DataFrame ready for longitudinal charts.

---

### **Cell 24 — Section Header: “12 — Self-Improvement Loop” *(Markdown)***

> **Narrative elements:**
>
> * Describe how low-scoring runs trigger a *prompt-tuning experiment* (e.g., try “You are an expert…” prefix).
> * Outline reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback (RLHF) stub, even if not fully implemented yet.
> * Mention scheduled cron job (external or notebook-based) that batch-re-trains or swaps models weekly.
>
> **Approach relevance:**
> Embodies the “Adaptability” pillar; turns feedback into concrete agent upgrades.
>
> **Success signal:**
> Iteration N+1 shows statistically significant metric improvement over N on held-out eval set (p < 0.05).

---

### **Cell 26 — Section Header: “13 — State Persistence & Logging” *(Markdown)***

> **Purpose:**
> Explain where and how artefacts live:
>
> * Metadata DB (`sqlite:///runs.db`) for lightweight deployments.
> * Optional external observability stack (ELK/Grafana) for production.
>
> **Why it matters:**
> Guarantees reproducibility, auditability, and debuggability—key ethical requirements.
>
> **Success criteria:**
>
> * Each run record includes: run-ID, prompt hash, task graph, agent params, final answer, metrics, feedback.
> * Disk footprint predictable; old logs rotated.

---

### **Cell 28 — Section Header: “☑️ End-to-End Runner (Optional)” *(Markdown)***

> **Explanation:**
> Acts as a convenience wrapper and smoke-test harness. Running this single cell re-executes the full pipeline in one go, ideal for CI or demo mode.
>
> **Relation to best practices:**
> Provides *quick validation* that notebook refactors haven’t broken the contract between cells—analogous to an integration test in software engineering.
>
> **How to know it’s good:**
>
> * Button click completes without manual intervention.
> * Summary banner prints overall latency, pass/fail, and key metrics; CI can parse this.

---

These expanded markdown narratives make the notebook self-documenting: every code cell is preceded by a detailed “why” and “how,” tightly linked to the broader agentic-system principles of autonomy, explainability, adaptability, and robustness.

### USER
Each "run" of the notebook needs to instantiate an incremental output directory where any and all verbose explanations of prompts, responses, decisions, user interactions, etc are stored in a separate file for each agentic thread, whether its the main one or one of the spawned ones. 

For each cell in the jupyter notebook in the list you have just created, add an explanation of what a clear, concise, complete visualization/explanation looks like for the output of the work being done in that cell. It needs to confer any and all verbose.

For example, a single run will have many agentic contexts for all the separate sub-tasks, for the various aspects of the main task, etc. These will all be saved in a separate file in the run instance folder. Those will contain all the fine detail about exactly what prompts were sent to ollama and what responses were received, what "thinking" occurred, and what was reported back to the main thread.

The output of the cells in the notebook needs to be a simple but complete summary of what is going on. Maybe something like "10/45 agents have reported back. Waiting on 35 more..."

Repeat the previous list and explain all the cells what this kind of good, clean, complete visualization looks like for each cell.

### ASSISTANT
Below is an augmented version of the **Markdown-only “chapter” cells**.
For each cell I keep the earlier purpose/logic bullet points **and** add a new section, **“✦ Runtime Output & Visualization”**, describing exactly what the *concise on-screen summary* should look like **and** what *verbose artefacts* are persisted under the run-instance directory (e.g. `runs/2025-06-12T23-14-07-Z/`).
This pattern guarantees:

* Users see a quick, readable dashboard in-notebook.
* Every detail (prompts, responses, traces) is durably logged—one file per agentic context—so nothing is lost.

---

### **Cell 0 — Notebook Title & Overview**  *(Markdown)*

*…(purpose / relation / success criteria as written before)…*

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:** A styled callout (Markdown) that prints the generated *run-ID* (timestamp + random suffix) and the *output directory* path, e.g.

  ```
  ▶︎ Run-ID: 20250612-231407-Z4R8
  ▶︎ Output Dir: runs/20250612-231407-Z4R8/
  ```

  This tells every downstream cell where to write its artefacts.
* **Filesystem:** The directory is created immediately; an empty `README.md` seed file records the notebook version hash.

---

### **Cell 2 — “1 — Environment & Config Initialization”**  *(Markdown)*

*…previous narrative…*

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:** After the paired code cell runs, display a *config table*:

  | Key        | Value                   |
  | ---------- | ----------------------- |
  | Ollama URL | `http://localhost:8000` |
  | GPU        | `NVIDIA A40`            |
  | Log Level  | `INFO`                  |

  A green ✅ badge shows “Ping OK” or a red ❌ if unreachable.
* **Filesystem:** Write full env snapshot to `runs/<id>/00_env_config.json`.

---

### **Cell 4 — “2 — User Prompt Capture”**  *(Markdown)*

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:** When a prompt is submitted, echo back a trimmed preview (first 200 chars) in a syntax-highlighted block plus a word/token count badge.
* **Filesystem:** Save raw prompt to `01_main_thread/prompt.txt` inside the run dir.

---

### **Cell 6 — “3 — Prompt Pre-processing”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

### **Cell 8 — “4 — Task Decomposition / Planning”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:**

  * A mermaid DAG diagram rendered inline (`graph TD; TaskA-->TaskB; …`) showing parent/child tasks.
  * A summary line: `Planned 4 tasks (2 parallel, 2 sequential)`.
* **Filesystem:**

  * `01_main_thread/task_graph.json` — canonical DAG.
  * `01_main_thread/plan_llm_trace.txt` — if an LLM produced the plan, the full reasoning chain.

---

### **Cell 10 — “5 — Model Availability Check & Selection”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:**

  * A table listing each task, requested capability, selected model, model size, and status badge (🟢 found / 🟡 user-supplied / 🔴 missing).
  * Any missing model triggers an inline prompt cell.
* **Filesystem:** `01_main_thread/model_map.json`.

---

### **Cell 12 — “6 — Agent Instantiation & Parameterization”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:** For each task, print a single-line summary:

  ```
  [+] Agent “summarizer-1” → model: llama-3-8B-Q4_K_M, temp=0.2
  ```

  Also a total count line: `Spawned 4 agents`.
* **Filesystem:** Inside `agents/` subfolder, create one directory per agent (`agents/summarizer-1/`) that will later collect its prompt/response trace.  Immediately drop `config.json` there.

---

### **Cell 14 — “7 — Orchestration / Scheduling”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:** A progress bar widget (or textual ticker) that updates live:

  ```
  ▇▇▇▇▢▢▢▢ 2/6 agent runs complete (ETA 00:14)
  ```

  Every 5 s prints a line: `Waiting… 2/6 done`.
* **Filesystem:** Append an `orchestrator.log` stream to the run root with timestamped scheduling events.

---

### **Cell 16 — “8 — Agent Inference Execution”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:** After completion, a compact table:

  | Agent        | Tokens Out | Latency (s) | Status |
  | ------------ | ---------: | ----------: | ------ |
  | summarizer-1 |        512 |         6.4 | ✅      |
  | classifier-a |         38 |         1.1 | ✅      |
  | …            |          … |           … | …      |

* **Filesystem:**

  * Each agent folder receives `prompt.txt`, `response.txt`, and `metrics.json`.
  * If streaming, `response.txt` is written incrementally then finalised.

---

### **Cell 18 — “9 — Result Collation & Integration”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:**

  * A collapsible diff/merge viewer showing how individual snippets were combined.
  * Single summary line: `Integrated 4 agent outputs into 1 response (1 conflict auto-resolved)`.
* **Filesystem:** `01_main_thread/integrated_response.md` plus optional `merge_log.txt`.

---

### **Cell 20 — “10 — Post-processing / Response Formatting”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:** The *final answer* rendered in Markdown exactly as the end-user will see it.
* **Filesystem:**

  * `final_response.md` (canonical answer).
  * If citations inserted, `citations.json` capturing source ↔︎ line mapping.

---

### **Cell 22 — “11 — Quality Evaluation & Feedback Capture”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:**

  * Auto metrics table (e.g., “Coherence: 0.92, Relevance: 0.87”).
  * Two inline buttons: 👍 / 👎 and a textbox for comments.
* **Filesystem:** Append feedback to `feedback.csv` with columns `[run_id, metric_json, user_thumb, comment]`.

---

### **Cell 24 — “12 — Self-Improvement Loop”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:**

  * A short changelog preview:

    ```
    ↺ Updated prompt template for summarizer-1 (v3 ➜ v4) based on low relevance score.
    ```
  * Bar chart of metric trends across last N runs (via `matplotlib` inline).
* **Filesystem:**

  * `self_improve/actions.json` detailing each tweak.
  * Updated `agents/*/prompt_template_v4.txt` where applicable.

---

### **Cell 26 — “13 — State Persistence & Logging”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:** Confirmation block:

  ```
  ✅ Run persisted: runs/20250612-231407-Z4R8/ (size: 2.3 MB, 42 files)
  ```
* **Filesystem:**

  * SQLite DB or JSONL appended with run summary.
  * Directory zipped (optional) for archival.

---

### **Cell 28 — “☑️ End-to-End Runner (Optional)”**

**✦ Runtime Output & Visualization**

* **On-screen:** After execution:

  ```
  🟢 All stages completed in 00:28.17
  Key scores → Coherence: 0.92 | User-Thumb: 👍
  Artefacts: runs/20250612-231407-Z4R8/
  ```
* **Filesystem:** No extra files; it merely invokes the preceding steps—artefacts already exist.

---

These additions ensure every notebook cell now specifies:

1. **Where verbose logs land** (one file per agentic thread in the run dir).
2. **What concise dashboard element appears** to keep humans oriented.
3. **How success/failure is signalled** in both the UI and the filesystem, satisfying the requirement for *simple but complete* visual summaries alongside exhaustive traceability.
